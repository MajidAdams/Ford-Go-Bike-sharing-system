## by (Abdulmojeed Adams)


## Dataset
This data contains information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. This dataset contains information about 183,215 gobike rides in the San Francisco Bay area with 16 attributes, detailing the times of rental and return, names of rental station and return, and information about the people lending the bikes. The dataset can be found in this github repository https://github.com/BetaNYC/Bike-Share-Data-Best-Practices/wiki/Bike-Share-Data-Systems.


## Summary of Findings

- There are more Subscribers (about 90%) than Customers (10%) with 75% of them being Males, 23% Females and 2% Other gender.
- Riders ages span from 18-78 with a few outliers above 78 but most riders are between the ages 23-38.
- For both Customers and Subscribers, the most rides are taken in the Evening and Mornings are there are more trips taken in the weekdays than at weekends. Thursday being the day with the most trips taken followed by Tuesday and Wednesday.
- Most rides taken are between 5 - 11 minutes with distances ranging from 0.5 - 2.2kms but Customers spend more time on trips and cover more distances on the average. 
- There is a positive correlation between distance covered and duration of trips but there is no correlation between these variables and ages of riders. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For this presentation, I focused on the distribution of the users which are two namely, Subscriber and Customer. Then I investigated the time of day most rides are taken with most rides taken at Evenings and Mornings. I further checked the day of the week most rides are taken and that happens to be Thursdays. The most rides are taken during the weekdays with less rides taken in the weekend.

I checked if there's a dependency of the average distance of trips on the two types of users, Customers and Subscribers with Customers completing longer trip distance on the average. Finally, I checked if there was a correlation between age of riders and distance covered but there was no correlation between them.
